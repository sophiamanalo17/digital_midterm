            <p>
                This is a website to switch between the original versions and plain language versions of my alt text comic.

              <p class = 'script1'>
                These are my first ever bowls that I am proud of making after spending the summer practicing on the wheel at my local pottery studio. I went with my mom and mine are the green ones on the right.

                These are dolls my boyfriend sent me a screenshot of because they reminded him of me, especially because I love miffy.

                This is a special moment to me because my friends from school visited me in San Diego, and we spent our days going around the city (this was a picnic)
